## Calendar description

Introduces the SAS statistical package. Data management; reading, editing and storing statistical data; data exploration and representation; summarizing data with tables, graphs and other statistical tools; and data simulation.

## Course Outline:

SAS component

  1. What is SAS?
      - Downloading and installing
      - Overview of the system
  2. Data management in SAS
  
      a. Data input and structures
      
          - DATA step
          - Reading specially formatted files
          - Date/time/character formats and manipulations
          - Derived variables
          - Exporting
          
      b. Data access: from database systems using query languages
      
      c. Merging and reshaping data
      
          - sorting/subsetting (set/if/where statements)/ merging/transposing
          - processing using DO LOOPS and SAS arrays
          - modify variable attributes
          
  3. Data exploration and representation in SAS
  
          - basic procs (print, plot, tabulate, means, univariate, freq)
          - by statement and uses in analysis and simulation
          - output delivery system to extract information from analyses
